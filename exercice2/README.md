# Exercice2: Test Plan
The purpose of the test is to create a test plan for the candidate pipeline part :

2. I create any candidate
3. I can retrieve the information about the candidate
4. I can comment the candidate

What particularly interests us in this exercise are the marginal cases that you will mention. 
We expect pragmatism, so avoid too much detail!
 
NB: no code required for this exercice
